If the dash attack hits: changes the next auto attack to a unique boosted attack with increased range. If Zoroark hits opposing Pokémon with Slash, Shadow Claw, Cut, or unique boosted attacks: resets the Night Slash buff duration to 2.5s, repeating this chain of attacks. This move ends if the user moves when they're unable to use the Night Slash dash attack.\n\n  If Zoroark hits opposing Pokémon with a total of 6 valid attacks: cleanses status conditions and becomes invincible for 1.4s,  jumping into the air then landing after 1.2s. When the user lands: slashes a cross-shaped area of effect, damaging opposing Pokémon with two diagonal slashes, and dealing additional missing HP damage when it hits; restores HP once for each of the two diagonal areas of the cross slash that hits an opposing Pokémon (up to 2 times if both slashes hit).  This cross-shaped attack deals move damage if triggered by a final move hit, or auto attack damage if triggered by a final unique boosted attack. While jumping, the user is able to use Slash, Shadow Claw, or Cut to move a set distance.",
